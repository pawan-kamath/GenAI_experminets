However, you can take precautions to protect your WLAN:\\nâ Use a wireless transmitter with built-in security .\\nMany wireless base stations, gateways, and routers provide built-in security features such as\\nwireless security protocols and firewalls. With the correct wireless transmitter, you can protect your\\nnetwork from the most common wireless security risks.\\nâ Work behind a firewall .\\nA firewall is a barrier that che cks both data and requests for data that are sent to your network and\\nthen discards any suspicious items.
